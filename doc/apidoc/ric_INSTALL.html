0. Preface

PHPOpenChat (POC) is a web-based chat system written in PHP 4 as Open Source Software (OSS). Your advantage is that you may use it without charge even for commercial purposes. Your disadvantage is that you have no [anspruch] for support or fulfillement of any requirements although some volunteers might give you support and some functionality may be provided.
To operate the chat system you won't need any commercial software packages, although it might run with one of these too. Instead it is sufficient to have Linux, Apache, PHP 4 and MySQL (LAMP) and of course a server computer attached to the internet (or any kind of TCP/IP network).

1. Unpack the archive

PHPOpenChat comes as a TAR-Archive oder ZIP-Archive. It will unpack itself into a subdirectory &quot;phpopenchat&quot;. Please unpack it in your DOCROOT directory.
We assume you have a HOME directory and a document root directory DOCROOT. DOCROOT is the directory where all files of your web server are stored. In the case of an Apache web server DOCROOT is often named 'htdocs'. It may but doesn't have to be under your HOME directory.
Example:

Document Root is under
/home/you/public_html
or
/var/www/html

PHPOpenChat is should be unpacked to
/home/you/public_html/phpopenchat
or
/var/www/html/phpopenchat

2. Check requirements and prerequisites
Do you have:
- PHP &gt;= 4.2.2 with MySQL-, or other DB-support
- MySQL (or other DB)
installed?

3. Copy files to destination host and directory
Hopefully done.

4. Create database and database user with access rights
Now you have to setup your database.
- create a database (In other cases than mysql, it may be called 'tablespace')
- create a database user with access rights to this database
- import PHPOpenChat's database-schema db.schema

5. Change configuration settings in config.inc
For a quickstart it's enoght to change the following settings:
- the hostname, where the database runs
  define('DATABASE_HOST','localhost');
- the database user with proper access rights
  define('DATABASE_USER','');
- the password of this database user
  define('DATABASE_PASSWORD','');
- the name of your created database which will contain your sql-tables (In other cases than mysql, it may be called 'tablespace')
  define('DATABASE_TABLESPACE','');

Now you are able to try http://your.host.tld/phpopenchat/
have fun!
