Integration of the PHPOpenChat (POC) into YabbSE

What I have to do to integrade the POC into my YaBBSE-installation?

1) Upload the image file 'button_poc.gif' to -> /path_to_forum/YaBBImages/
2) Setup the following properties within the file 'poc.php'

$poc_doc_root  = '/phpopenchat'; // directory name of your POC installation
$poc_root_path = './../phpopenchat'; // the relative path from YaBBSE installation to POC installation

Example:
you have YaBBSE in the directory 'forum' and 
your POC in the directory chatb7 already installed.
In this case, your setup must look like as follows:

$poc_doc_root  = '/chatb7';
$poc_root_path = '../chatb7/';

Upload the file 'contrib/yabbse/poc.php' into the yabbse install directory

3) Adaptation of YaBBSE's menu. Go on as follows:

edit the file 'path_to_forum/Sources/Subs.php'
search for:
$yymenu .= "$menusep<a href=\"$cgi;action=shownotify\">$img[notification]</a>";

Insert the following code below this line:
$yymenu .= "$menusep<a href=\"poc.php\"><img src=\"$imagesdir/chat.gif\" alt=\"Let's go into the chat!\" width=\"45\" height=\"22\" border=\"0\"></a>";

Now a chat-button is available for registered member. Guests doesn't get
access to the chat.

Some relevant properties of POC's 'config.inc.php':
Example 1: You want that only registered users of yabbse can access the chat.
Guests must register to be able to chat.

define('ALLOW_GUEST_LOGIN',false);
define('SEND_CONFIRMATION_MAIL', false);
define('AUTOLOGIN_DIRECTLY', true);

okay, users can login to the chat only if they are registered user of yabbse.

Beispiel 2: You want that
            - yabbse's registered users are able to chat,
            - users are able to register for the chat only
            - guests can access the chat without a yabbse membership.

define('ALLOW_GUEST_LOGIN',true);
define('SEND_CONFIRMATION_MAIL', true); //switch to false if you don't like registration mails.
define('AUTOLOGIN_DIRECTLY', false);

With this setup, the POC is successfully integrated into yabbse. 
Users are able to use the chat without registring to the yabbse forum.
Also guest-access is anabled.
